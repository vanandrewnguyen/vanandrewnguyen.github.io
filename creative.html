                Hey :)
                <br><br>
                Wanted to have fun and make this quick page to show some stuff I usually wouldn't. There's a lot of more, unfinished unreleased personal work below. 
                Wanted to show less of what I can make and how I make them.

                Pixel Art:
                Pixel art's a pretty ugly medium by itself so it makes sense to use techniques which hide its ugly aesthetic. 
                One way to do this is to anti alias heavily, however, if you embrace its limitations by going the opposite route, you end up with some very, definitive results.
                Exhibit below, playing with monochromatic schemes is pretty fun.

                Game screenshots:
                Post-processing makes pixel art much easier to consume. You can get away with crude pixel-art (see below) when
                you add gradient noise and other screen-space effects to vary the colour output.

                        Went the opposite path and kept lighting flat and little blending on vfx, 
                        you can see the results differ substantially with very different aesthetic.

                Shader Screenshots:
                These shaders below are one entire script each :). 
                Writing shaders generally is more technical than artistic, but man, 
                playing around with the positioning and colouring models makes you *feel* like an artiste.

                        This ones pretty cool because you can fake atmospheric effects as a 2D texture instead of a 3D algo.
                        Included this because an optimisation decision is still an artistic one :)

                        I love that scene in Disney's Up when Carl navigates through the thunderstorm, been trying to recreate that effect
                        ever since I started graphics programming. This is as far as I've gotten.

                        Lighting a scene is probably the most aesthetically important decision you can make,
                        this is a crude, boring raymarch of a mountainside, but the lighting just elevates it to look better than it does.

                        See LHS, here you can get creative with the noise algos you put in, in this case you can generate canyon-like features
                        by blocking off sections. Honestly, there's like so much more you could do, but this was one of my first experiments on
                        playing with generative terrain.
