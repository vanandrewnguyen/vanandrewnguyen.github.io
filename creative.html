                Hi!!!! 
                <br><br>
                Wanted to have fun and make this quick page to show some stuff I usually wouldn't. There's a lot of more raw, unfinished personal work below. 
                Wanted to show less of what I can make, and how I make them. Also wanted to nerd out.

            <p class="body-content">
                Pixel art's a pretty ugly medium by itself so it makes sense to use techniques which hide its ugly aesthetic. 
                One way to do this is to anti alias (place pixels of a similiar colour, think blending but to show detail rather than transitions) heavily.
                <br> 
                However, if you embrace its limitations by going the opposite route, you end up with some very stark results.
                <br>
                Exhibit below, playing with monochromatic schemes is pretty fun.

                            Basic volumes and character pose. Posing is the biggest issue, because the canvas is so limited
                            it's often hard to distinguish between set poses with pixel-art.

                Post-processing makes pixel art much easier to consume. You can get away with crude, 'crunchy' pixel-art (see below) when
                you add gradient noise and other screen-space effects to vary the colour output. Personally I hate the classic 
                toon cel-shading, most modern games blend it with traditional diffuse and bloom (like below).

                        a bunch of bloom added on top to mimic that colour pixel effect on old arcade machines.

                        Went the opposite path and kept lighting flat and little blending on vfx, 
                        you can see the results differ substantially with very different aesthetic.

                These shaders below generated with one script each!. 
                Shader writing is generally more technical than artistic, but man, 
                playing around with the positioning and colouring models makes you *feel* like an artiste.

                        This one's pretty cool because you can fake atmospheric effects as a 2D texture instead of a 3D algo.
                        Included this because an optimisation decision is still an artistic one :)

                        I love that scene in Disney's Up when Carl navigates through the thunderstorm, been trying to recreate that effect

                        Lighting a scene is probably the most aesthetically important decision you can make,
                        this is a crude, boring raymarch of a mountainside, but the lighting just elevates it to look better than it does.

                        You can get creative with the noise algos you put in, in this case you can generate canyon-like features
                        by blocking off sections. It's very much an artistic choice, and what's even better is that I'm lazy and I used the 
                        exact same noise algos to shade these canyons as well!!! Work smarter not harder :)
